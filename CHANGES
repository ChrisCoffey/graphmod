* Version 1.2.3

  [Collapse Modules]
  The flag "--collapse-module" ("-C" for short) adds a new mode of collapsing
  multiples nodes into a single one.  This is similar to "--collapse" except
  that the parameter can refer either to a module name, or to a module prefix.
  So, for example, "--collapse-module=A.B" will use a single node for the
  module A.B (if there is one), as well as for any module that starts with
  the prefix A.B (e.g., A.B.C).

  "Collapsed" nodes are represented with a box.

  Collapsed nodes corresponding to modules have a border, while ones which
  correspond to just a prefix do not have a border.


  [Color Schemes]
  The flag "--colors" ("-s" for short) enables users to choose from
  a set of predefined color schemes.


* Version 1.2.2

  [Show Version]
  The flag "--version" ("-v" for short) shows graphmod's version.
